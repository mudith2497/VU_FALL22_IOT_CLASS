# OPTIONAL SETUP

1.This step only connects your devices to the local area network (LAN) of the router. You cannot access the Internet currently. In order to connect to the Internet, please finish the setup procedures below and then follow Internet to set up an Internet connection.Connect your device to the LAN port of the router via Ethernet cable.

2.Guest Wi-Fi is turned off by default, you can turn on it for visitors. Guest Wi-Fi is separated from the default Wi-Fi. That is, you can only access the Internet in Guest Wi-Fi, not the web Admin Panel.

## This step below is for " Cloud Management "

GL.iNet GoodCloud cloud management services provide an easy and simple way to remotely manage routers.

4.On the left side of web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> Remote Access -> Dynamic DNS
Dynamic Domain Name Service (DDNS) is a service used to map a domain name to the dynamic IP address of a network device.

## The step below is for pulling back the connection from network diagnostics 

5. This step is regarding information of router connection. If anyone is having trouble with connecting with your local network and if your system is popping up messages like " Unable to connect to the network , please run network diagnostics " or stuff like that go to your network settings and forget the network because the problem arises when your system automatically connects to router network.
when we forget the network the system will ask password ( which we have assigned to the router) when we try to connect it again. Enter the password after establishing connection to the network and go to the link http://192.168.8.1 and select Repeater category in Internet and assign your local network to the router by scanning and entering the respective credentials of your network.

6. You can set a captive portal in our routers, when newly users connect to the Wi-Fi, they need to access a web page before access the internet.
