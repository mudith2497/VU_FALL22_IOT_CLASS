# VU_FALL22_IOT_CLASS

Hi everyone my name is Mudith Potta

# MOTIVATION

I've done my undergraduation in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and I've learnt how to deal with sensors and I'm always curious to learn about sensors and IoT devices that is one of the main factor for creating this Git hub repository so that users can access my experiment experiences and intresting pieces of code which will help the github users to enhance their skills in the field of IoT and also develop the skill of understanding the different kinds of data which can be accessed with the use of this repository .That is the reason which has driven me to create this repository.I ensure to provide unique and interesting information regarding IoT for the users through this repository.
