I've done my undergraduation in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and I've learnt how to deal with sensors and I'm always curious to learn about sensors and IoT devices that is one of the main factor for creating this Git hub repository so that users can access my experiment experiences and intresting pieces of code which will help github users to enhance their skills in the field of IoT and also helps to develop the skill of understanding different kinds of data which can be accessed through this repository .That is the main reason which has driven me to create this repository. I ensure to provide unique and interesting information regarding IoT and other technologies for the users through this repository.
