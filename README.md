# VU_FALL22_IOT_CLASS

Hi everyone my name is Mudith 

# MOTIVATION

I've done my undergraduation in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and I've learnt how to deal with sensors and I'm always curious to learn about sensors and IoT devices that is one of the main factor for this Git hub repository so the people can access my experiment experiences and intresting pieces of code which will help the repository users to enhance thier skills in the field of IoT and also to develop the skill of understanding the various types of data which are created with the use of this repository.
