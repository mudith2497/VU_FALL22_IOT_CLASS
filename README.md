# VU_FALL22_IOT_CLASS

Hi everyone my name is Mudith Potta

# MOTIVATION

I've done my undergraduation in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and I've learnt how to deal with sensors and I'm always curious to learn about sensors and IoT devices that is one of the main factor for creation of this Git hub repository so that users can access my experiment experiences and intresting pieces of code which will help the github users to enhance thier skills in the field of IoT and also to develop the skill of understanding the various types of data which can be with the use of this repository.
