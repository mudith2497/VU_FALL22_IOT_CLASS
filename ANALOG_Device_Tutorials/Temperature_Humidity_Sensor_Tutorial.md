 ## Bread Board

This is a 'full-size' premium quality breadboard, 830 tie points. Good for small and medium projects. It's 2.2" x 7" (5.5 cm x 17 cm) with a standard double-strip in the middle and two power rails on both sides. You can pull the power rails off easily to make the breadboard as thin as 1.4" (3.5cm). You can also "snap" these breadboards together, either way, to make longer and/or wider breadboards. The back is made of foam double-sided tape, if you remove the protective paper you can attach it to a flat clean surface.
